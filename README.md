# reputation
Prototyping the blockEDU distributed reputation system based on UniTEC

Considering using devp2p kad with DSHT modifications. This is similar to the Swarm bzz method where we will communicate with ethereum nodes until we find a node that speak `rpp`. This peer will send a list of other nodes in it's lookup table that will bootstrap the connecting node into the reputation protocol.
